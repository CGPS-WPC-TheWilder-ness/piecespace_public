**Welcome! I'm Blair.**

**This is a sample written composition piece intended for inspection by Fuel Network and Co.;**

**despite its lengthiness, I hope this written piece provides your overall process with data/information/insight helpful for whatever your hard problem on hand might be at the time being,**

In my world, the first thing I do is treat peace as a computational, piecewise-continuous, evolutionary, optimization _process_—not a product. Everything else follows from there, the peace-process always comes first. This is my unique value proposition and personal operating platform.

The optimization problem is simple: how does one assemble all the pieces in their world to configure and connect externally with other worlds to maximize net individual sense of inner peace (peace in the subjective product-sense) while minimizing net individual sense of inner war? In the professional setting, this means thinking of inner peace and war in terms of how successful an individual, team, or entire organization’s efforts are at solving their _hardest_ problems first, be these technical, architectural, business, cultural, personal, etc. I believe the only way to accomplish this reliably is to use the world pieces to build a framework—a world piece computer—to run the peace-process and interface with other worlds to share a seamless reliable global process that leverages _deliberate and explicit_ communication protocols to facilitate functionalities such as error correction, objective function evaluation, hardest-problem alignment, nesting iteration synchronization, etc.

In any technical leadership capacity the value-add I aspire to is proportional to the number of people I am able to integrate with my process, plus the degree to which they are similarly process oriented—relentlessly communicative, striving to focus only the hardest problems _first_, all other problems following by dependency, every action, interaction, inaction, and so on, a _deliberate_ step toward overcoming the global _impossible_ problems. This is why I believe my actual value to offer is the assertive and unconventional ethos of computational peace I foster, not just my (limited) software engineering experience and corresponding skillset. The rest I believe must only ever be the _means_ to an end—the engineering technique, the programming skills, the domain expertise. The ultimate end is to solve the _impossible_ problems. This is what it takes to _survive_ as an organization long enough to realize the vision and project it beyond, and _thrive_ in the process along the way. This is what it takes to realize any vision of epic proportion.

I believe that when a person or community maintains an explicit computational peace-process to focus honestly on the impossible problem at hand, then dependent problems like individuals needing to master a new technical skill on the fly are a simple matter of applying regression to a simple template, something like:

*   Solve hardest problem first.
    
*   Then solve next-hardest problem first to solve first-hardest problem.
    
*   converge on the global solution.
    
*   Optimize the process template.
    
*   Re-execute with new template to optimize solution.
    
*   Repeat loop and signal status upward in process loop-nest.
    

This sounds like basic engineering, which it is by virtue of problem-solving being the act of solving many smaller problems, but it is _explicit commitment_ to the characteristics of computational peace that differentiates between the usual best-effort and what I believe is a synergistic framework that promotes productivity by unifying worlds. A common peace-based process executes in a lingua franca that fosters the interworld compatibility and exchange of process-pieces—tools, tricks, objectives, protocols, procedures, etc.—that have been proven to work best via deliberate, iterative process evolution.

As a worker with this mindset in me, I aspire to operate at a senior / staff / c-level capacity, regardless of the formal role I fill. I take pride knowing that when I feel _welcome_ operating at this capacity (plus the resources I need are available and I am free of undue obstruction), I am comfortable tackling problems often first deemed impossible. Approaching these types of problems, I engineer my peace-process to integrate various algorithmic truisms, such as Arthur C. Clarke’s three laws for example.

My offer as a professional therefore, although perhaps risky (and contrarian according to past coworkers), is to commit to delivering _beyond_ what is initially thought possible when focusing on the hardest problems first: if hired, then I cannot help but strive to _overpromise_, then _overdeliver_, and hold myself accountable with a _satisfaction guarantee_.

In general I would approach this by attempting to integrate my peace-process with relevant external and internal Fuel Labs world pieces, installing my operating platform where appropriate to support the mission of realizing the greater vision through the lens of my own version: a Fuel OS _optimizing in a piecewise-continuous evolutionary manner_ for PSI, hopefully in the future spanning _multiple ecosystems_. I believe that as a concept transaction rollups on Ln+1 chains have universal application in the blockchain space, and PSI is a universal hardest-problem that I believe will always need solving _better—_stakeholder min/max inner war/peace optimization being my natural inclination.

I would be overjoyed to discover a great cultural fit with Fuel Labs, and if invited, to discover a world I can feel at home in, comfortable operating at capacity as appropriate. Finally, indulging as a pure-artist favoring conceptual style, I really think the Fuel OS tech as a conceptual archetype is super cool, super badass, proper innovation. So even if we aren’t a great fit, I really hope you all succeed in realizing the vision to maturity.

_This letter is deliberately long and unconventional, strategic, sometimes tactical. Among other reasons here, I often reserve long-form composition for situations where a surplus of content and attention-load may empower the audience to decide on a next-action YES/NO with greater confidence, thus maximizing the likelihood that all stakeholders save time. In daily operation I usually find no need for long-form._

_**\*peace process technical note:**_

_The optimization process that I deploy in my personal world piece computer is an extension by analogy from variational mechanics in modern physics to an analogous subjective form that espouses the same least-action principle, with some embellishments. I would be happy to speak on that project directly, or write up a technical piece that outlines the toy-model gestalt of the subjective physics/mechanics developing._
