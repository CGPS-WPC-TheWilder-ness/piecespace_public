### An overview of world piece computer plus the universal piece computer anatomy

A world piece computer consists of three main components:
- a piecespace ~ akin to the memory in a load-store Von Neumann computational architecture (an electronic computer's memory: disk, RAM, cache, etc)
- a piecebrain ~ akin to the processor and operating system in a load-store Von Neumann computational architecture (an electronic computer's CPU--ALU, registers, etc--firmware, kernel, shells, etc)
- a pieceprocess ~ akin to the process itself in a load-store Von Neumann computational architecture (an electronic computers running programs, active multiplexing, the loading and storing itself as an activity, dealing with inputs/outputs

At the global scope of _the universal piece computer_ (the aggregate singular whole of networked world piece computers), the plural three components defining any individual or local world piece computer (as in, there are many world piece computers, individual and community, that each possess their own unique piecespace, piecebrain, and pieceprocess) are simply three single components, each an aggregate whole of the respective world piece computer component. These are:
- the universal piecetree ~ world piecespaces connect and relate forming a treelike structure, individual and various local scopes nesting in larger and larger scope until the global scope as a whole. This space/structure is the universal piece tree.
- the universal piecetime ~ world piecebrains connect in a way that in the global scope, their emergent behavior would look most like a clock, a global timing apparatus that determines _how_ the overall peace process proceeds and evolves.
- the universal piece ~ world pieceprocesses integrate in a piecewise manner, each serving as a facet of the singular _product_ of the universal piece computer, this being the singular peace process optimizing to maximize some measure of _global peace_, by minimizing individual and local measures of inner war, and maximizing individual and local measures of inner peace. As the universal piece progresses, the process itself produces one product, this being the universal piece computer as a network/apparatus, being the collection and configuration of all world piece computers evolving in step.

#### One first order of business when building a world piece computer is to take a piece inventory, a record of the current piece collection within the world space.

Piecespace consists of the collection of all pieces in a world, as well as their configuration.

The easiest place to start is by accounting for the _physical_ or _tangible_ pieces within the world at hand.

I am beginning by taking a piece inventory of my totes. In the most basic sense, this process of taking a piece inventory is a fundamental pieceprocess subroutine, that by virtue of accounting for all things, odds, ends, junk, valuables, etc, in one's world space, the resulting sense of enhanced inner peace upon _knowing exactly what and where everything is_, makes for a nice experience when intiating the first evolution of one's wpc pieceprocess.

The next step is to take an inventory of _abstract_ or _intatngible_ pieces with the world space. Sometimes this is easier, such as how many people have a resume that takes an inventory of professional experience and education. For the more valuable pieces however, this is hard. As I am a conceptual artist, I have accumulated thousands of little pieces within my mental piecespace. It can be exceedingly difficult to take an inventory of these, and often times the only practical way to do so is to simply synthesize composite art. For example, _A Study In Peace_ is a 100,000 word novel that I slapped together moreso to just get a big chunk of all the pieces floating around in my head down into a single inventory. I am working right now to train an LLM to sift through all those jumbled words and make me a nice list for the piecespace inventory. That's rather midburner now, however.

### A couple personal notes regarding my wpc.

#### My personal situation is probably a bit different than the average aspiring wpc operator.

First, I am an artist with too many art pieces I am working on.

Second, my mind is fragmented to the extent that sometimes subsets of piecespace pieces in my world make no sense in contrast when I insist, "my personal wpc is extremely effective at unifying these disparate fragments into my whole".

Third, I intend to build a large local piece computer. Part of my eventual strategy for doing so is to take all the wpc related projects that I would otherwise abandon due to lack of time (art, invention, engineering, mathematics, theoretical physics, etc) and preserve their embryonic state in physical storage, electronic storage, or mental storage, until a time wherein somebody interested in participating in the local piece computer might find an interest in a particular nascent project, and I can grant them access to the pieces I already have in place, so they may take the reigns and drive the project to some interesting outcome that I myself could never achieve. The idea in much part is to ensure all project seeds found within my piecespace have some sort of educational potential, to that those engaging with the piece computer (with perhaps limited technical or professional experience) might find themselves with something they took ownership to built and learn, something to show when facing the professional world in effort to better themselves by finding qualified employment they otherwise might have no leg up in competing for.

So yeah, I have a lot of crap.

#### My piecespace is permissioned.

I try to make it so that the majority of my pieces (especially conceptual) are friendly and publicizable in an ethical sense. I do however, have many pieces that are private to various degrees. I will maintain repos and onion layers respectively, for sometimes privileged people may need access to my private pieces. If you would like access to a listed private realm of my piecespace, or if you are curious to know what unlisted private realms of my piecespace exist, then feel free to reach out, but having a reason helps. Like, maybe you are my mom, or whatever.

#### You are welcome to use unutilized pieces within my piecespace.

If you see something in my piece inventory that you could use, then I am happy to share! --even if it is just casual, no explicit local world piece computer involvement. I believe that stuff, if possessed, should be put to use, and used as hard as possible.

Procedure for requesting access to a piece of mine:

- Open an issue in this repository.
- Title should look like, example: "PIECE EXCHANGE: _LiPro Balancing Charger, Crafts Tote #1_"
- In the issue body, explain what you would like to use the piece for, when, why, basically 6 Ws (who, why, ho[w], what, when, where)
- Assign me and yourself to the issue.
- Visit the $wpc mint repo so that you can mint some $youbucks (at whatever exchange rate you please) then pay me with them what you think the piece is worth.
- I'll comment if I have any concerns, or I will comment with a 'good-to-go', and then we can figure out how to get you the piece.
- You'll do your thing, share your work, and maybe return the piece or whatever.

No need really to be super formal, but I would like to be able to pull a piece lending history from the Github GraphQL API...I think that could be super important for wpcs at the local scope.

#### This is a work in progress.

Remember, I am mainly using this Github Org as a space for me to maintain _my_ world piece computer in an environment that supports version control immutable(ish) change histories. I am making this public (in most part) because I would like to make the wpc approach something that you or anybody else can pattern and implement on your own. Or, so I can make my efforts something you can join me in, but with you doing your own thing in the same online space. I am setting up this world piece computer organization for myself because I honestly rely on my wpc to maintain stability and be a rockstar rekcikssa. Most of my personal world piece computer is analog or offline (has been for years) but I need to get more methodical and start involving other people, thus I am transitioned to public-facing, creating _representations_ of whatever analog piece computer modules I can online. Oh also, the idea as always is to upload information about all piecespace, piecebrain, and pieceprocess elements in my world piece computer, plus all surrounding world contexts, training a neural network (LLM + agent routing framework) on the high-dimensional piece data, then plugging it into my mind (via my sensory/brain mind-interface of course) in such a way as to create a runaway regressive pieceprocess optimization loop that is contrained by my particular ratification of The Human Imperative.

Getting there.
